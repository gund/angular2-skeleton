## Features

### Available Plumber template methods:

#### includeAsString(file:String, doNotInject:Boolean=true)

Will include content from *file* and if *doNotInject* equals true - will exclude file from being injected into main HTML file.  
Good for inclusion HTML files.
  
**Usage:**
  
```html
<%= includeAsString('./app/app.html', false) %>
```
  
#### includeAsCss(file:String, minify:Boolean=false, doNotInject:Boolean=true)

Will include CSS *file* and if *minify* equals true - minify it's content; if *doNotInject* equals true - will exclude file from being injected into main HTML file.  
Good for inclusion CSS files.
  
**Usage:**
  
```html
<%= includeAsCss('./app/app.css', true) %>
```
  
#### includeAsSass(file:String, minify:Boolean=false, doNotInject:Boolean=true)

Will include SASS or SCSS *file* and if *minify* equals true - minify it's content; if *doNotInject* equals true - will exclude file from being injected into main HTML file.
